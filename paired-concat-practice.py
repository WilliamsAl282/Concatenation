# Concatenation Practice


# Work with your assigned partner
# Each person in your team should take turns writing the code to create and display longer strings
# Check your partner's code for spelling, capitalization, and coding errors
# Correct any bugs in your code

# Part 1
# Create variables to store your first, middle, and last name
# Have Python print a message that contains your concatenated full name, i.e., your combined first, middle and last names
first_name = ('Alexander')
middle_name = ('Troy')
last_name = ('Williams')
full_name = first_name +" " + middle_name + " " + last_name 
print(f'Hello my name is {full_name}')



# Part 2
# Assume you're building a Space Invaders game
# Use concatenation to create and display a custom welcome message that includes the player's first name
first_name = ('player')
last_name = ('name')
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(f'Hello {full_name} and welcome to space invaders')

# Part 3
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that includes your first name, last name, and the year you were born
first_name = ('Alexander')
last_name = ('Williams')
birthday = (2007)
full_name= first_name + " " + last_name
print(f'My name is {full_name} and my date of birth is {str(birthday)} ')


# Part 4
# Use concatenation to create and display a sentence that says which country in the world
# you would visit if money were no object
full_name = ('Your full name?')
input(full_name)
